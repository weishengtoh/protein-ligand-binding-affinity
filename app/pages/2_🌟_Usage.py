    # Usage ðŸŒŸ  
    There are several entry scripts to run the training/inference. In general 
    however, the command to execute a script in the terminal has the format:   

    ```shell
    python <entry_script> -C <path_to_config_file>
    ```  

    To use horovod to train on multiple GPUs on a single node, use the command:  
    ```shell
    horovodrun -np <number_of_gpus> python <entry_script> -C <path_to_config_file>
    ```

    ### Entry Scripts

    The available entry scripts are:
    | SCRIPT | DESCRIPTION |  
    | ------ | ----------- |  
    | train.py | Runs the training on a single GPU. Training logs and models are stored locally. |
    | train_wandb.py | Runs the training on a single GPU. Training logs are uploaded to Weights and Biases (wandb) in real-time for experiment tracking and visualisation. Trained model are also uploaded to wandb for model versioning. | 
    | predict.py | Generates the prediction on a single GPU/CPU. Prediction outputs are saved in the `outputs` folder. |
    | train_horovod.py | Runs the training on multiple GPUs in a single node. Training logs are uploaded to wandb in real-time for experiment tracking and visualisation. Trained model are also uploaded to wandb for model versioning. |

    ### Predefined Configuration Files

    Configuration files are defined in the form of a yaml file, and they are where 
    the user may choose to modify the *model, training and inference* parameters.  

    There are several predefined configurations file included in the folder `configs` that corresponds to a pretrained model in the `pretrained` folder:   
    | SMILES ENCODER | FASTA ENCODER | REGRESSOR | CONFIG FILE| TRAINED MODEL | 
    | -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | 
    | Convolutional 1D | Convolutional 1D | Fully Connected | configs/cnn_cnn.yaml | pretrained/cnn_cnn.yaml | 
    | Graph Convolutional Network | Convolutional 1D | Fully Connected | configs/gcn_cnn.yaml | pretrained/gcn_cnn.yaml | 
    | Graph Isomorphism Network *(Attribute Masking)* | Convolutional 1D | Fully Connected | configs/ginmask_cnn.yaml | pretrained/ginmask_cnn | 
    | Graph Isomorphism Network *(Edge Existence Prediction)* | Convolutional 1D | Fully Connected | configs/ginedgepred_cnn.yaml | pretrained/ginedgepred_cnn |

    ### Modifying / Creating Configuration Files
    Other than using the config files that were included, it is also possible to define your own config file to build and train a custom model architecture.  

    Configuration files are composed of three components:
    1. Model Hyperparameters  
    2. Training Hyperparameters  
    3. Inference Hyperparameters  

    The **model hyperparameters** section **MUST** be defined in all configuration 
    files, as this is where the model architecture is defined.  

    The **training hyperparameters** and **inference hyperparamters** sections are 
    **OPTIONAL**, depending on whether you are running training or inference.
